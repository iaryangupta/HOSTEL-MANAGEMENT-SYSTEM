# HOSTEL-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A university wants to implement a Hostel Management System. First, they wish to store details of Students living in Hostel like Name, Roll no, Room no, Due fees and Phone Number. The system also needs to store details of hostel and mess payment including the amount along with start and end date of duration for which the payment was made. Room details (Room no, Floor and Room type) are also stored. All the details of the wardens incharge of the hostel at different timings of the day (like their Name, Emp_Id, gender, age) are to be included as well. The Hostel Authority also wants to make sure that it properly addresses and solves all the grievances of the students for their better living. Moreover, the entry and exit of students is also to be recorded for their safety. Keeping all this in mind design a database for the above given information.
